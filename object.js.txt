JavaScript these objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types
(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol)
An object, is a reference data type. 
Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value. 
That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored. The variables don’t actually store the value.

JavaScript variables,
both the object name (which could be a normal variable) and property name are case sensitive. 
You can define a property by assigning it a value. For example, let’s create an object named myCar and give it properties named make, model, and year as follows:

var mycar = new Object();
mycar.make = 'Ford';
mycar.model ='Mustang';
mycar.year = 1969;
